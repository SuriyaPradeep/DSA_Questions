# DSA Questions
## Arrays
1.Max Min:-Given an array A of size N of integers.Your task is to find the sum of minimum and maximum element in the array.

2.Array Reverse:-Reverse an given array.

3.Missing Number in An Array:-Given an array of size N-1 such that it only contains distinct integers in the range of 1 to N.Find the missing element.

4.Print an Array of N:-Print Elements in Array Without using Loop.

5.Sort 012's:-Given an array of size N containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s; sort the array in ascending order.

6.Sum of Series:-Write a program to find the sum of the given series 1+2+3+ . . . . . .(N terms).

7.Value Equal to Index Value:-Given an array Arr of N positive integers.Your task is to find the elements whose value is equal to that of its index value ( Consider 1-based indexing ).

8.Chocolate Distribution:-Given an array of N integers where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that: 
Each student gets one packet.
The difference between the number of chocolates in the packet with maximum chocolates and the packet with minimum chocolates given to the students is minimum.

9.Search in Rotated Sorted Array:-There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).
Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].
Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

10.Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock:-You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

11.Next Permutation:-A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.
For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].
The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).
For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.
Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.
The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.

12.Repeat and Missing Number Array:-You are given a read only array of n integers from 1 to n.
Each integer appears exactly once except A which appears twice and B which is missing.
Return A and B.

13.Trapping Rain Water:-Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

14.Product of Array Except Self:-Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

15.Maximum Product Subarray:-Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return the product.
The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

16.Two Sum:-Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

17.Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array:-Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:
[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].
Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

18.Find if there is a pair with a given sum in the rotated sorted Array:-Given an array arr[] of distinct elements size N that is sorted and then rotated around an unknown point, the task is to check if the array has a pair with a given sum X.
