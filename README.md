# DSA Questions
## Arrays
1.Max Min:-Given an array A of size N of integers.Your task is to find the sum of minimum and maximum element in the array.

2.Array Reverse:-Reverse an given array.

3.Missing Number in An Array:-Given an array of size N-1 such that it only contains distinct integers in the range of 1 to N.Find the missing element.

4.Print an Array of N:-Print Elements in Array Without using Loop.

5.Sort 012's:-Given an array of size N containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s; sort the array in ascending order.

6.Sum of Series:-Write a program to find the sum of the given series 1+2+3+ . . . . . .(N terms).

7.Value Equal to Index Value:-Given an array Arr of N positive integers.Your task is to find the elements whose value is equal to that of its index value ( Consider 1-based indexing ).

8.Chocolate Distribution:-Given an array of N integers where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that: 
Each student gets one packet.
The difference between the number of chocolates in the packet with maximum chocolates and the packet with minimum chocolates given to the students is minimum.

9.Search in Rotated Sorted Array:-There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).
Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].
Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
